# Debezium-Postgres-Camel-Extension

Welcome to the magical land of database change data capture (CDC), where we take the mundane task of tracking Postgres changes and make it as entertaining as binge-watching cat videos. This repository contains an extension of the Debezium Postgres Connector, cleverly designed to make your data pipelines run smoother than your morning coffee.

## What's in the Box?

This project extends the Debezium Postgres Connector using Apache Camel, enabling you to effortlessly capture database changes, log them with style, and do it all with a smirk on your face.

## Pre-requisites

Before you dive into this wild ride, make sure you have the following:

- **Java 21+**: Because we're fancy like that.
- **Apache Maven 3.8.8**: To build and package your dreams.
- **PostgreSQL 16**: The trusty old friend that we're listening to.
- **Quarkus**: Because we like things fast and lean.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repo**:
```
git clone https://github.com/rajat965ng/debezium-postgres-camel-extension.git

cd debezium-postgres-camel-extension
```

2. **Compile the Code**:
```
mvn clean install
```
If everything works fine, you'll be rewarded with a freshly baked jar file in the target directory.

3. **Run the Application**:
```
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```
Sit back, relax, and watch as your database changes get logged like they're in a reality TV show.
